This project is a simple React app (no Vite, no Next.js) that displays data from a Firestore collection called 'flagged_users'.

- Use Firebase JS SDK for Firestore access.
- The UI should list flagged users, show their flagged post details, notes, and history.
- No authentication, just read-only display.
